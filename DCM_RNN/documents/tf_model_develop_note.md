# Initializer Model
-
- It works on 


### Hyper parameters:
- Gradient mask: control gradients back-propagated to each variable
- Sparse mask: if True, a corresponding variable has sparsity cost
- Prior mask: if True, a corresponding variable has prior distribution based cost
- 

### Variable:
- Connection variables
- Hemodynamic variables


### PlaceHolders:
- Training data
- Variable masks
- Learning rate
-
